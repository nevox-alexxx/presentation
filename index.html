        <h2>The Evolution of Programming Languages</h2>
        <p>Understanding how technology has shaped coding.</p>

        <aside class="notes">
          Hello everyone!
          Today, I`ll guide you through the fascinating journey of how programming languages have evolved over time.
          We`ll start from the earliest forms of machine communication and go all the way to modern AI-driven
          technologies.
          Let`s dive in!

          <aside class="notes">
            First, what exactly is a programming language?
            It`s a formal set of instructions that tells a computer what to do.
            Just like human languages help us communicate with each other, programming languages help us communicate
            with machines.
            They translate human intentions into actions that computers can perform.

          <ul>
            <li>1940s-1950s: Assembly languages and machine code</li>
            <li>First generation of programming</li>
          </ul>

          <aside class="notes">
            Let`s go back to the 1940s and 1950s.
            The very first 'languages' were simply machine codes — sequences of 0s and 1s.
            Later, assembly languages appeared, allowing people to use simple words instead of binary code.

          <aside class="notes">
            Computers like the ENIAC (this is actually a first computer) were programmed manually with switches and
            cables — a truly hands-on process!

          <h4>The First Computer Bug</h4>
          <p>In 1947, engineers found a real moth inside the Mark II computer, causing a malfunction.</p>
          <img src="./img/first-bug.jpg" alt="First Computer Bug Logbook" />
          <aside class="notes">
            Here's a fun historical story: In 1947, while working on the Harvard Mark II computer,
            engineers found that the machine wasn't working correctly. Upon inspection, they discovered a moth stuck
            between the computer's relays, causing the malfunction.
            They carefully removed the insect and taped it into their logbook, noting it as the "first actual case of a
            bug being found."
            This is where the term "computer bug" comes from — although the term "bug" for mechanical issues existed
            before, this event made it famous in computing history.

        <h4>The Rise of High-Level Languages</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>1957: FORTRAN</li>
          <li>1960: COBOL</li>
          <li>1964: BASIC</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="./img/timeline.webp" alt="Timeline of Early High-Level Languages" />

        <aside class="notes">
          High-level languages made programming much easier.
          FORTRAN, developed in 1957, was one of the first. It made complex calculations faster and more efficient.
          COBOL, created in 1960, was designed for business applications.
          And BASIC, from 1964, brought programming to students and hobbyists.
          These languages abstracted away much of the complexity.

        <h4>The Structured Programming Era</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>1970s: C, Pascal, Ada</li>
          <li>Focus on logic, readability, maintainability</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="./img/pascal.png" alt="Structured Programming Code Example" />

        <aside class="notes">
          By the 1970s, programmers sought better organization and structure in their code.
          Languages like C, Pascal, and Ada introduced the concept of structured programming.
          Instead of chaotic flows, code was now clean, logical, and much easier to maintain.
          This was an essential step toward modern software engineering.

          <h4>Object-Oriented Revolution</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>1980s-1990s: C++, Java, Python</li>
            <li>Concept of "objects" and "classes"</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            Then came a major shift — object-oriented programming, or OOP.
            Languages like C++, Java, and later Python emphasized 'objects' — pieces of code that represented real-world
            concepts.

            This allowed for modular, reusable code, making software development faster and more intuitive.
            Today, OOP remains a core principle in most applications

          <aside class="notes">
            The mid-90s changed everything again with the birth of the internet.
            JavaScript made websites interactive, PHP powered dynamic web pages, and Ruby simplified scripting.

          Kotlin powers Android apps; Dart fuels Google's Flutter for mobile.
          Python and R dominate in machine learning and data science.
          Languages evolve to meet the needs of new industries — and that evolution is faster than ever.

        <aside class="notes">
          In summary, the evolution of programming languages mirrors the evolution of technology itself.
          From hand-wiring machines to writing AI algorithms, each step made programming more powerful and more
          accessible.
          The future promises even more exciting changes — perhaps programming without code at all!
